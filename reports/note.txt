Limitation:
1. This model is for educational purposes only and demonstrate how machine learning is works. Not for production phase.
2. This dataset has been taken from 2020-2023 (Latest downloaded: September 6, 2023 at 09:58 AM). Therefore, if you use this model in 3-5+ years later to predict how much your salary will be, maybe it's not accurate anymore.

Conclusion:
1. The best model used for salary prediction is XGBoost.
2. The prediction results can be off by approximately US$ 38897 (MAE) from the actual price, or in percentage terms the salary prediction will be off by approximately 31.82% (MAPE) from the actual salary.
3. Experience level is the most importance feature, the higher your experience, the greater the salary is. (in this order: Entry-level / Junior (EN), Mid-level / Intermediate (MI), Senior-level / Expert (SE), Executive-level / Director (EX)).

Recommendation:
Things that can be done to improve model performance:
- Add some features such as:
a. experience year: How many years of experience in that field.
- Collect more data
- Add more parameters when perform hyperparameter tuning to get best parameters
- Try more complex model like Deep Learning
